# [Going to the EGU part 1](http://hansbrenna.github.io/opinion/2016/03/14/slaying-dragons)
I'm attending the European Geosciences Union General Assembly conference this week. The event is huge and hosted in Vienna, something like 15000 geoscientists attend, and I have a poster to present this afternoon. After I have presented it, I'll upload the possterr to figshare and link it here.
