# Comparing the CMIP5 model temperatures to HadCRUT4
Often, I see the claim that the models used in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) are overestimating global temperatures compared to what is observed. I wanted to check this myself, so I downloaded the [CMIP5 global temperatures from 42 models]() and the [HadCRUT4 global mean temperatures]() from the beacon of sound climate science (*irony*) [www.wattsupwiththat.com](www.wattsupwiththat.com) and got to work.

Figure 1 shows the HadCRUT4 temperatures together with the mean and standard deviation of  CMIP5
