# Chemistry Climate Model Initiative Workshop 2015
I presented a poster, this October at the CCMI workshop i Frascati, outside of Rome in Italy. This was my first conference/workshop as part of my PhD studies, and I presented some preliminary results from my research project. I've made it avialable on my [Figshare account](http://figshare.com/articles/Modelling_the_Combined_Impcat_of_Chlorine_and_Bromine_from_Large_Plinian_Eruptions_on_Ozone_and_the_Stratosphere/1600935)

The CCMI is an activity coordinated by SPARC where the goal is to follow up the evaluation of chemistry climate models, like WACCM or CAM-Chem, tha can be used to study atmospheric chemistry by simulating in a consisten way, both the circulation and the chemisry of the atmoshere.

My research project, that I've been working on for some months now, consists in using the Whole Atmosphere Communtiy Climate Model (WACCM) to study the impact of volcanic eruptions on ozone chemistry in the stratosphere. I will try to use this blog to present my work as it is evolving.
