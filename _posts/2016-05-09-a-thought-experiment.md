# [A thought experiment concerning back radiation](http://hansbrenna.github.io/analysis/2016/05/09/a-thought-experiment)

## Some context

In the following I'll use the conventional definitions of shortwave and longwave radiation as $$\lambda < x \, \mu m$$ and $$\lambda > x \, \mu m$$ respectively

## The thought experiment
At $$z=0$$ we place a perfectly absorbing and emitting infinite plate (i). Homogeneous monochromatic ultraviolet radtiation ($$\lambda=200\, nm$$) is coming from an energy source at infinite distance from our setup, and radiating towards the plate at $$z=0$$. At some finite distance $$z$$, far from (i) is another plate (ii), perfectly transmitting for the incoming UV radiation and with constant absorptivity $$0 < \alpha < 1$$  for all wavelengths except $$\lambda=200\, nm$$. Both plates are thin, perfectly conducting and with negligible heat capacity. Right underneath plate (i) is a layer with emissivity 0, so that no energy is lost in that direction. Between the plates, and outside the setup is perfect vacuum.

The distance between the two plates is large. So large that the transit time for radiation between them is much larger than the time it takes each plate to equilibrate with the incoming energy.

At time $$t=0$$ the system is in equilibrium, with incoming radiation balanced by thermal radiation from (i) and (ii). At time $$t=t_1$$ the absorptivity of (ii) is changed, to become closer to 1. As a consequence, the plate will quickly equilibrate to a new temperature and a new thermally radiating state. This change in the state of (ii) will not be detected by (i) for some time, since the information travels with the speed of light. At a later time $$t=t_2$$ the information reaches (i) which then equilibrates with the new state of (ii). This will then lead to a series of temporally distinct
