This is my first post on this new blog I made with Jekyll Bootstrap, hosted on GitHub. I will be using this blog to promote my research, but hopefully I will also be able to find time to write some political texts about the major issues that I'm interested in or worried about. 

I'm a climate science PhD student at the University of Oslo, and my research topic is on the effect of explosive volcanic eruptions on the ozone layer. I will be posting updates about my research as it progresses, and there will hopefully be news about that rather quickly.

AS for other topics, as I said, I would like to find the time to write some posts about issues that I care about, a few of which are open science, the politics of the international scientific community, climate politics and economics. I will also be posting updates about my software projects that are hosted on GitHub. These are mainly for my own use, but there is nothing wrong with others using them. I use python for my data processing and plotting, and when I find anything interesting about Ptyhon, I might do a post on that.
